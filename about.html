			<p>Previous solutions to integrating Growl with Notification Center have involved forwarding all notifications, whether you wanted them or not. Others have everything appear as "Growl." Not with Bark. We work around Apple's limitations. <a href="http://getsonora.com/">Sonora</a> is Sonora, just as it should be.</p>
			<p>In a Skype chat that gets thousands of messages? Twitter mentions catching you off guard? Have no fear, your screen won't be spammed with notifications. Thanks to Growl, No matter how many notifications are recieved, you'll only be bugged by one app at a time, with infinite flexibility.</p>

			<p>Bark is simple: you don't switch apps for it, it isn't a hack, it isn't a script. You'll never miss a thing, because Growl notifications stay in Notification Center when you're using Bark. And because Bark is a Growl plugin, apps don't need to change a thing to support it.</p>

			<p>It's just another plugin you enable. Starting with Growl 2.0, Bark is an <em>action plugin</em>. This means that you can use Bark along with a regular Growl theme and apps like <a href="http://www.prowlapp.com">Prowl</a> and <a href="http://boxcar.io/">Boxcar</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="smart">Smarter than the average plugin</h2>

	<p>With Bark, apps don't show up as notifications from "Growl". They show up just as themselves, and clicking on notifications will launch or activate the appropriate application just as you'd expect.</p>

	<h2 id="faq">Things you might ask (frequently)</h2>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Does it cost me anything?</h3>
			<p>Bark is completely free for personal use. However, it was developed for and tested with the <a href="http://growl.info">Mac App Store</a> version of Growl. Support the developers of great apps!</p>
		</div>

		<div class="span2">&nbsp;</div>

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Why is this not part of Growl?</h3>
			<p>Bark modifies of Notification Center to  present notifications on behalf of other apps. It uses a technique similar to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>'s Finder integration, and is definitely not allowed in the App Store.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Bark has disappeared!</h3>
			<p>Under Growl 2.0 and up, the plugin has to be copied into Growl's sandbox. Open the plugin located at <code>/Library/Application Support/Bark/Bark.growlView</code>.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="span2">&nbsp;</div>

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>How do I uninstall Bark?</h3>
			<p>The Bark settings in Growl have an "Uninstall" button, though might not work on some weird systems. There's an uninstaller at <code>/Library/Application Support/Bark/Bark Uninstaller.pkg</code>.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Why isn't this open source?</h3>
			<p>Bark goes to great lengths to make its technique invisible to the user. We feel high-profile availability of this method would do a disservice to the community. However, your thoughts have been heard and Bark may be open source one day.</p>

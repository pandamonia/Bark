			<p>Previous solutions to integrating Growl with Notification Center have involved forwarding all notifications, whether you wanted them or not. One of Growl's best features is that it allows for fine-grained control over what you see and what you don't. Bark gives you all of this while still allowing you to peek into the slick, sleek Notification Center at any time. Get as much control as you want.</p>
			<p>In a Skype chat that gets thousands of messages? Twitter mentions catching you off guard? Have no fear, your screen won't be spammed with notifications. Thanks to the features of Bark and Notification Center, no matter how many notifications are recieved, you'll only be bugged by one app at a time.</p>

			<p>Bark is simple: you don't switch apps for it, it isn't a hack, it isn't a script. It's just another theme you switch to like <a href="http://growl.info/stylesarchive.php">Spongebob</a>. You'll never miss a thing, because Growl notifications stay in Notification Center when you're using Bark.</p>

			<p>Because Bark is a Growl plugin, apps don't need to change a thing to support it. Anything that's used the Growl framework since the days of PowerPC and Leopard can use Bark and join the new decade and its carnivorous cat operating systems.</p>

	<h2 id="smart">Smarter than the average plugin</h2>

	<p>With Bark, apps don't show up as notifications from "Growl". They show up just as themselves, and clicking on notifications will launch or activate the appropriate application just as you'd expect.</p>

	<h2 id="faq">Things you might ask (frequently)</h2>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Does it cost me anything?</h3>
			<p>Bark is completely free for personal use. It was developed for and tested with the <a href="http://growl.info">Mac App Store</a> version of Growl, though may also work with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pmetzger/growl">Growl Fork.</a></p>
		</div>

		<div class="span2">&nbsp;</div>

		<div class="span5">
			<h3>Why is this not part of Growl?</h3>
			<p>Bark modifies of Notification Center to  present notifications on behalf of other apps. It uses a technique similar to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>'s Finder integration, and is definitely not allowed in the App Store.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="span12">
			<h3>Why isn't this open source?</h3>
			<p>Bark goes to great lengths to make its technique invisible to the user. We feel high-profile availability of this method would do a disservice to the community by making security exploits possible.</p>
